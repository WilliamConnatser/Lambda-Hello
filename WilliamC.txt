Hello,

Oops. I just realized I forgot to include three words that describe me, so in this alternate reality I will provide both words that are like and unlike me! Without further ado...
Like Me: laid back, hard worker, sometimes funny
Unlike Me: professional juggler, pet rock hoarder, crafter of fine tin foil hats 

My name is not William Connatser. I like to eat ice cream with mayonnaise and ketchup, but only when I'm not hanging out with other A-list celebrities. When I go out I usually wear the finest mink coat I can find in my closet, but if it is too hot for that then I'll wear a silk shirt instead to keep me cool!
